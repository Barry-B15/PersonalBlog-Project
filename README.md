# Personal Blog
 My first project for the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree program.
This project was to make a personal blog with html and css imports into a main css file.
To meet requirements for the project, I have done the following:
* Arranged all files into directories 
* Used grid in not less than 3 places in my css
* Used flexbox in at least 2 places
* Imported subfiles into my main css file.
* Added captions to the images where I feel they are necessary
* Made used of HTML semantics
* Made it mobile friendly and checked device renderings of the project with dev tools.
