 My first project for the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree program.
This update tries to fix some of the issues seen by the reviewer on the first one I submitted on Feb. 5
I have:
*added captions to the images where I feel they are necessary
*reorganized the files into directories
*made used of HTML semantics
*added extra flexbox to the my css
*and checked device renderings of the project with dev tools
